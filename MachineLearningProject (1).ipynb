This is especially important for those who have recently undergone change in their life and need to find another hobby. For example, if someone has undergone an injury and cannot perform their favorite hobby anymore, using this tool they will be able to enter their favorite hobby and be given options of similar hobbies with descriptions of how the hobbies differ. The user would then be able to use their own discretion and pick a recommended hobby that is well suited to themselves."

From this, there may be a hobby that fits better in their lifestyle characteristics, such as their current alloted time, cost, or physical intensity for the hobby. This could be very helpful for college students in particular since each week can look very different from the next. However, it can also work well for those who have recently experienced changes in their lives, such as less time they can commit to a hobby or an injury that prevents them from endulging in their past hobbies."
